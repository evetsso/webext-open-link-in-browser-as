Open Link in Browser As
=======================

Open Link in Browser As is a Firefox WebExtension that adds a context menu item for forcing links to open in browser.
You can specify type of content if Server-reported type is wrong.
It serves as a limited replacement for [Open in Browser](https://github.com/spasche/openinbrowser).
